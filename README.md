# Ball-Game-Computer-Graphic-Project
This project is a computer graphics game written in C++ and designed using various shapes such as Cube, Quad, Circle, Polygon, Cone, and Sphere. The game has two main animations: the ball and the moving scene.

# Gameplay
The game is a simple ball-rolling game where the player controls a ball by moving it left or right using the keyboard. The objective of the game is to collect as many points as possible by collecting coins that are scattered throughout the game. The game is over if the ball falls off the screen or collides with an obstacle.

# Shapes
Various shapes were used to design the game environment, including a ground, field, houses, windmill, and baby doll.

# Animations
Two main animations were implemented in this game. Firstly, the ball is animated to roll around the game environment, and secondly, the entire game environment is animated to move in one direction, creating the illusion of movement.

# Function Implementations
Several functions were implemented to make the game function properly. These include the ball movement function, sound function, score function, animation function, keyboard function, and time function.

# Contributors
This project was created by a team of developers who worked together to complete the design and implementation. The team was made up of designers and programmers who worked on different aspects of the project to bring it to completion.

# Conclusion
This computer graphics game project showcases the ability to design and implement a functional game using various shapes and animations. The game has been developed to provide entertainment and challenge to its players, and it is hoped that it will be well received by the gaming community.
